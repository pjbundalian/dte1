# Running the `code_snippet.sh` Script

This guide provides instructions on how to run the `code_snippet.sh` script, which processes the `file_diff.txt` file to organize changed files into respective directories based on their modification status.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have a Bash shell available. This script is designed to be run on Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and macOS.

## Files Overview

- `code_snippet.sh`: The Bash script to be executed.
- `file_diff.txt`: Contains the status and paths of files that have been changed (e.g., added, modified, deleted, renamed).

## Directory Structure

Ensure your project directory is set up as follows before running the script:

```
project_directory/
│
├── code_snippet.sh
├── file_diff.txt
│
└── src/
    ├── objects/
    ├── profiles/
    └── reports/
```

## Instructions

1. **Open Terminal**: Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing `code_snippet.sh`.

2. **Make the Script Executable**: To make `code_snippet.sh` executable, run the following command:
   ```
   chmod +x code_snippet.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script by running:
   ```
   ./code_snippet.sh
   ```

The script will process the `file_diff.txt` file, and based on the contents, it will organize the changed files into the `deployPackage/added` or `deployPackage/removed` directories. It will also generate `added.txt` and `removed.txt` files listing the names of the processed files.

## Expected Outcome

After running the script, your directory structure will include:

```
project_directory/
│
├── added.txt
├── removed.txt
│
├── deployPackage/
│   ├── added/
│   └── removed/
│
├── file_diff.txt
│
└── src/
```

- `added.txt`: Lists files that were copied to `deployPackage/added/`.
- `removed.txt`: Lists files that were moved to `deployPackage/removed/`.

For further assistance or to report issues, please contact the script maintainer.
